## Project Overview
The project aim at ....
## Data Source
The data souce is Kaggle.com and can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabbas757/coffee-sales)
## Tools 
- MS Excel 2019 - Row Data 
- MySQL - for Data Cleaning, Preparation and Analysis
- Power BI - for Data Analysis and Visualization 
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In this phase I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data formatting
## Explanatory Data Analysis
In this EDA step I tried to show the following requirements which a hypotherical coffee shop owner would be interested in to have insights:
## *KPI's Requirements*
### 1. Total Sales Analysis:
- Calculate the total sales for each month
- Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in sales
- Calculate the difference in sales between the selected month and the previous month

- Calculate the total number of orders for each month
- Determine the month-on-month increase in the number of orders
- Calculate the difference in the number of orders between the selected month and the previous month
### 3. Total Quantity Sold Analysis:
- Calculate the total quantity sold for each month
- Determine the month-on-month increase or decrease in the total quantity sold
- Calculate the difference in the total quantity sold between the selected month and the previous month
## *Charts Requirements*
### 1. Calendar Heatmap:
- Implement a calendar heat map that dynamically adjusts based on the selected month from a slicer
- Each day on the calendar should be color-coded to represent sales volume, with darker shades indicating higher sales
- Implement tool tips to display detailed metrics (Sales, Orders, Quantity) when hovering over a specific day
### 2. Sales Analysis by Weekdays and Weekends:
- Segment sales data into weekdays and weekends to analyze performance variations
- Provide insights into whether sales patterns differ significantly between weekdays and weekends
### 3. Sales Analysis by Store Location:

- Highlight MoM sales increase or decrease for each store to identify trends
### 4. Daily Sales Analysis with Avergae Line:
- Display daily sales for the selected month a line chart
- Incorporate an average line on the chart to represent the average daily sales

- Provide insight into which product categories contribute the most to overall sales
### 6. Top 10 Products Sold:
- Identify and display the top 10 products based on sales volume
- Allow users to quickly visualize the best-performing products in terms of sales
### 7. Sales Analysis by Days and Hours:
